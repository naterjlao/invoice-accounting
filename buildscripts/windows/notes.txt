packaging that actually works?
https://pypi.org/project/pynsist/
https://packaging.python.org/overview/

pushes the entire python lib into install directory
only for windows

-could be used to push the correct Python directory to the folder (need to check if this is so)
-makes an installer, but this is useless
-need to be in conjunction with the vstudio installer
    -- or just vstudio by itself
-needs a link towards a icon on desktop
